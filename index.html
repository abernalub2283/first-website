        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>My History</h2>
            <p>Born in Colorade and grew up in rural Indiana. Currently living in a small town in IN with my boyfriend and our two cats. Constantly trying to learn. I hope to be a polyglot in the future.</p>
        <h2>Interesting Things</h2>
            <p>I love to crochet and read. I lived in Tennessee for half a year.</p>
        <h2>My Pets</h2>
            <p>Two cats, Ash and Cinder, as well as a hedgehog, Basil. I've always wanted a conure, but they're pretty expensive. Grew up in a home full of animals, and love any and all fuzzy critters.</p>
